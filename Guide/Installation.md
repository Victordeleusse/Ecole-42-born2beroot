# Born2beRoot Installation

Installing the Born2beroot VM has several steps involved: the creation of the virtual machine (VM) in VirtualBox, the installation of Debian OS with the creation of the root user, the partitionning of disks (including LVM) and the choice of initial software.

## Creating a Virtual Machine in Virtualbox

1. Launch VirtualBox & click New.
2. Name Born2beroot, sotre it in `/sgoinfre/goinfre/Perso/your_login` if at 42, or else on a large USB stick (important tip given by a stud !). Choose Linux & Debian.
3. `1024MB` memory is good.
4. Create a virtual hard disk now.
5. `VDI`
6. `Dynamically allocated`
7. `10 to 13 GB` is enough for both mandatory and bonus parts.
8. Start Born2beroot virtual machine.
